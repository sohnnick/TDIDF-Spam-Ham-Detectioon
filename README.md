# TF-IDF YouTube Spam/Ham Detection
Datasource found here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/YouTube+Spam+Collection.

Course: DSCI - Applied Machine Learning

### Summary
Utilized Python's Sklearn library to determine whether a YouTube comment is Spam or Ham. Converted text data into a Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency statistic to run Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes Classifier.

### Reflection
This was my first experience with Natural Language Processing. I developed a stronger mathematical understanding of Logistic Regression and the Naive Bayes Classifier. In the future, I plan on using cross validation for future NLP projects as opposed to a simple train-test split.
